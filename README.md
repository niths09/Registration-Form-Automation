# Para Bank Project

## Description
The ParaBank project is an automation script for testing the functionalities of the ParaBank online banking application using Selenium WebDriver. The script performs actions such as account registration, login, and logout by interacting with the web elements on the application. 

## Features
- **User Registration**: Automates the process of filling out and submitting a user registration form with details like name, address, phone number, and more.
- **Login**: Automates the login process using the credentials created during registration.
- **Logout**: Automates the logout action after logging in successfully.
- **Page Interactions**: Handles actions like filling out form fields, clicking buttons, and scrolling through pages.
- **Synchronization**: Implements explicit waits to ensure that the script interacts with elements only when they are available for interaction.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that the following are installed on your system:
- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher
- **Eclipse IDE** (or any other IDE that supports Java)
- **Selenium WebDriver**: The Selenium WebDriver Java library is needed to interact with the browser.
- **ChromeDriver**: The ChromeDriver executable is required for Chrome browser automation.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language for writing the test script.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A tool for automating web browser interaction.
- **JUnit** (optional, not included in the provided code but can be used for structuring tests).
- **ChromeDriver**: A standalone server that implements WebDriver's wire protocol for Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome.
