# SignUp Genius Automation  

This project automates the user registration and login process on the SignUpGenius website. The script demonstrates Selenium WebDriver's capabilities for interacting with dynamic web elements and handling browser-based automation tasks.  

## Features  
- Automates the user registration process, including inputting personal details and solving a CAPTCHA manually.  
- Automates the login process for the registered user.  
- Includes JavaScript-based scrolling for seamless interaction with the page.  
- Performs logout functionality to complete the user flow.  

## Prerequisites  
Before running this project, ensure you have the following:  
1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 8 or above.   
2. **Google Chrome** - Latest stable version.  
3. **ChromeDriver** - Version compatible with your Google Chrome browser.  
4. **Selenium WebDriver** - Included in the project dependencies.  
5. **CAPTCHA solving capability** - The script pauses for manual CAPTCHA solving.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Java** - The programming language for automation.  
- **Selenium WebDriver** - For interacting with web elements and automating browser actions.  
- **Google Chrome & ChromeDriver** - For browser automation.  
- **JavaScript Executor** - For advanced browser interactions such as scrolling.  

## Notes
