# LambdaTest Playground Project

## Project Description
This is an automation script designed to test the registration and login functionality of the Ecommerce Playground website. It utilizes Selenium WebDriver with Java to simulate user interactions, such as filling out forms, navigating through pages and verifying successful actions. This script automates the process of creating a new user account, logging out and re-logging in, ensuring the website's core features function as expected.
